## Overview <a id="overview"></a> [🔝][@jump-to-top]

The repo contains 5 contracts and one interface.

The `Bank` contract is for holding all balances of workers and company and billing companies.

The `WorkerPayroll` contract is for adding worker, storing worker and paying to workers

The `PhoneOperator`, `InternetProvider` and `ElectricityCompany` contracts are for storing bill payments and paying bills.

There will be added another informations when I have spare time.
